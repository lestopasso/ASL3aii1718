                Read the text below to discover the innovations shown in the picture.<br><br>
                <bdi class="Bold Colore">1 - Smart Traffic Lights</bdi> <br> They transmit information regarding traffic flow and on car park usage; they register speed and set the traffic lights based on the number of pedestrians. In a nutshell: they are at the service of the community, importantly increasing safety.<br><br>
                <bdi class="Bold Colore">2 - A Spy in the Dumpster</bdi> <br> The throwing away of waste in the mixed waste bins is constantly controlled and the vehicles which empty the bins automatically read the data. The fee increases in proportion to the quantity of residual waste that you produce. Therefore, sort your waste, it’s worth it! <br><br>
                <bdi class="Bold Colore">3 - Let's Recharge!</bdi> <br> The electric car has a very low environmental impact, it is built with materials and sensors that guarantee maximum safety and minimise the risk of accidents. Its batteries are charged by the recharge columns, smart points of smart grids, which use electricity production peaks.<br><br>
            </article>
            <article class="col right">
                <bdi class="Bold Colore">4 - The Eco-Streetlamp</bdi> <br> It regulates the intensity of the light according to vehicle density and pedestrian flow; it has  environmental sensors; it registers weather data and gives updated weather forecasts; and it offers a video surveillance service. Naturally, the lighting is LED.<br><br>
                <bdi class="Bold Colore">5 - Remote-controlled Heating</bdi> <br>Thanks to district heating, the flames of the burners of every single building will go out. The district heating network can be managed by remote control; the temperature is constantly regulated according to the needs of the single user and based on the current weather conditions. This way, you can save energy and pollute less!<br><br>
                <bdi class="Bold Colore">6 - Green Buildings for a Green Future</bdi> <br> Green buildings are constructed with innovative techniques and materials which make them a model of sustainability and energy efficiency. They can be self-sufficient, thanks to photovoltaic panels and storage batteries, possibly integrated with the district heating network.
