					Every day many <bdi class="Bold">quality</bdi> controls are carried out on tap water. There are strict regulations that establish which substances must not be present and the maximum values of those which, in high quantities, could be dangerous to our health or may change the taste or the colour of the water. 
The work of the laboratory begins at the <bdi class="Bold">source</bdi> and follows the path of the water, with samples being taken at <bdi class="Bold">various points along the aqueduct</bdi>, which are then analysed to ensure that it is still absolutely pure when it reaches our taps.
Its purity is also guaranteed by the supervision of human activities carried out in the “buffer zones”, which are “controlled areas” established to protect the sources of water supply from any contamination.

In addition to the analyses carried out by the water utility companies, the water is also controlled by the <bdi class="Bold">ARPAs</bdi> (Regional Environment Protection Agencies) which certify that it is potable and in compliance with parameters established by law. The quality is also controlled in real time by means of automatic measuring instruments. In addition to this, monitoring and control systems allow for the remote surveillance of the plants in order to detect, and correct, possible anomalies.
