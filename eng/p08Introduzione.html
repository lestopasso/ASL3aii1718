				The <bdi class="Bold">reuse of objects</bdi> is a keystone for the sustainable management of the waste that we produce daily; in reusing objects, you can <bdi class="Bold">increase the life
				cycle</bdi> and/or <bdi class="Bold">reduce the consumption</bdi> of the <a href="p08Ipertesto.html" class="Bold">raw materials</a> (and of the energy) necessary to manufacture other goods that perform the same function. 
				So what can you do with the things you no longer need? Better to give them away than to throw them away! For example, you can give the clothes you no longer wear to friends or to charity, and old toys
				to nursery schools or paediatric hospitals. Sometimes a small action is enough to breathe new life into something: this is certainly the case for the leftovers of a meal which can be made into a delicious new dish.
				Rather than throwing an object away, try to repair it or pass it on to someone else! A few examples? Try repainting old furniture
				(vintage is so fashionable!), cut plastic bottles in half, fill them with earth and use them to cultivate flowers or aromatic herbs
				or use your creativity to transform waste into a small work of art.
				In the next game, we’ll give you some words that lend themselves to be reused.
				</article>
				<article class="col">
				  With a little thought, each word (changing, adding or moving a letter)
				turns into another word - so as not to be thrown away, but re-used, as the new word also makes perfect sense! You’ll see, we’ll have some fun without wasting anything...
				<br>
				For each word, we’ll give you the new definition and tell you what you have to do to work it out:

				<ul class="listStyle" style="padding:5px; margin:5px; border:5px;">
				<li> <p>from <bdi class="Bold">CHAIRS</bdi> (by changing a letter), you get something that binds or restrains;</p></li>
				<li> <p>from <bdi class="Bold">BAG</bdi> (with the addition of one letter) you get a sudden loud noise;</p></li>
				<li> <p>from <bdi class="Bold">SKIRT</bdi> (by changing a consonant) you get another piece of clothing;</p></li>
				<li> <p><bdi class="Bold">BREAD</bdi> is an anagram of a word meaning facial hair;</p></li>
				<li> <p>from <bdi class="Bold">DOLL</bdi> (by changing a vowel), you get something boring and uninteresting;</p></li>
				<li> <p>from <bdi class="Bold">CAKE</bdi> (by changing a consonant), you get a box or... an instance.</p>
				</li>
				</ul>
