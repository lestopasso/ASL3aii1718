                        Perhaps surprisingly, the battery-powered car was one of the first cars to be invented and commercialised and was popular right up to the beginning of the 20th century, when it was superseded by the more powerful, but alas polluting, combustion engine car. The very first <bdi class="Bold">electric car</bdi> was built in the 1830s, the prototype of which, over time, was gradually perfected up to the beginning of the 1900s, when electric vehicles even held numerous speed records (for example, in 1899, a new 100 km/hour world record was set by an electric vehicle!) and were able to travel considerable distances powered on just one battery charge.<br>
Today, interest in electric cars has increased considerably, due to environmental issues as well as improvements in technology: the electric car is <bdi class="Bold">sustainable</bdi> and <bdi class="Bold">energy-efficient</bdi>. E-mobility is certainly changing the way we get around, and no doubt will alter our perception of cities in the next few decades, as it will make them quieter and less polluted.<br>
What's more, car manufacturers are proposing electric cars at more affordable prices.

                       The new models are designed with new technologies that improve battery life and performance, reducing charging times.<br>
There are also foreseen benefits to gain for ”green” vehicle owners such being exempt from tariffs in limited traffic zones and from circulation taxes or paying less insurance.<br>
In addition, the network of electrical <bdi class="Bold">charging points</bdi> around towns and cities are noticeably more widespread nowadays and electric vehicles are even becoming more commonplace in company fleets and local public transport.<br>
Don't forget that the "electric revolution" is not just limited to the electric car, but also includes many other types of vehicle like lorries and vans, as well as two-wheeled vehicles such as the e-bike: all solutions that can help us get around more conveniently, ecologically and with very little effort!
