This experience, came about following the development of the exhibition "Are you Eco-logical? Games and Solutions for Sustainability” created and presented at Genoa’s 2016 Science Festival by Iren and the AMGA Foundation.<br>
The original project, newly enhanced with more content and fun cartoons, has been transformed into a web application thanks to the work carried out by the students from the 4th and 5th  years of the I.T. Section of the Secondary School "Italo Calvino" in Genoa.<br>
This entrepreneurial project, approved by the Regional Education Board of Liguria, is part of the Iren Educational Programme and is one of the various work-related learning experiences promoted in the areas in which the company operates.<br>
As a result, the students have matured within an entrepreneurial training environment, which has stimulated their creativity and interpersonal skills, providing them with valuable business knowledge.  Meetings with the Chamber of Commerce were set up, in addition to flipped classroom training on technology innovations and lessons given by Iren representatives and freelance professionals, with the aim of defining the project specification and analysing particular issues, such as the rationale and criteria for the selection of suppliers and for procurement, brand identity, communication strategies and gamification techniques. The project was then shared out between several teams of students, each team’s progress periodically being monitored by Iren.<br>
The experience, based on a unique approach, whilst being complex in terms of time and commitment, proved extremely stimulating and the entrusting of centennials with the development of a web design product resulted in being more effective in enhancing the educational message aimed principally at the younger generations.<br>
In May 2018, the project won the first national award in the contest "Storie di Alternanza" promoted by the "Unioncamere" and the Chambers of Commerce, with the objective of rewarding the best work-related learning experiences undertaken by  Italian secondary schools.<br>
