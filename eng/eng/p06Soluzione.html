					Alas, the island in the picture really does exist! Even worse, there are five of them, not found on any maps, but present in oceans. The most famous is the <bdi class="Bold">Great Garbage Patch</bdi>,
					discovered in the Pacific. It’s a huge accumulation of rubbish of unknown dimensions (some people think that it might even be bigger than the United States!) mostly composed of plastic,
					and it has partly decomposed into a polymer “broth” which is very dangerous for the ecosystem.
					Growth of consumption, urbanisation and the economic development experienced in the last few decades has led to a <bdi class="Bold">dramatic increase</bdi> in the production of waste and reduced the areas that can be used as dumps.

						And waste has changed a lot over the years: it used to be mainly organic and easily broken down (animal carcasses, excrement, pottery fragments, scrap material etc.),
						but nowadays, we have to deal with plastic packaging, consumer goods (which have a short lifetime!) along with electrical, electronic and toxic waste…
						But we cannot and must not sweep the dirt any longer under the carpet: the carpets are now all used up! It is crucial that we change our habits and that means everyone doing their
						own part. But how? Well, by following the 3 Rs Rule – <bdi class="Bold">Reduce</bdi>, <bdi class="Bold">Reuse</bdi> and <bdi class="Bold">Recycle</bdi> –, which you will learn more about it in the next few steps.
