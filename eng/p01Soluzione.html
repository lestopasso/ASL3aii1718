					Every day, the mere action of turning on a tap to have water flowing freely is often taken for granted. And yet, until the first decades of the last century, taps were not actually commonplace, not even, as one might believe, in richer countries, as water was drawn out of a <bdi class="Bold">well</bdi> or from <a class="Colore Bold" href="p01Ipertesto-1.html">fountains</a>. And it is still a privilege today if we think about the fact that one out of every four people in the world doesn't have access to drinking water.<br> 
					But where does our water come from?<br> And how does it get to our homes? 
					The supply sources are <bdi class="Bold">aquifers</bdi>, <bdi class="Bold">streams</bdi> and <bdi class="Bold">rivers</bdi>, <bdi class="Bold">natural lakes</bdi> or <bdi class="Bold">reservoirs</bdi> created by dams (through which, thanks to the height differences created, it is also possible to produce energy).  Our water can be disinfected or undergo <a class="Colore Bold " href="p01Ipertesto-2.html">purification treatments</a>, sometimes simple, other times complex, depending on the origin and the quality of the water.  It is then channeled into a <a class="Colore Bold" href="p01Ipertesto-3.html">network</a> of underground pipes where it can be stored in <bdi class="Bold">tanks</bdi>, often suspended to guarantee sufficient pressure. Eventually, it reaches our homes through a dense <bdi class="Bold">distribution network</bdi>.<br>
					So use it with care: it doesn’t flow out of the tap by magic!  It is the result of a long and complex process, involving pipes and plants, continuous quality control, machines, materials and energy (electrical and human!) required to make it ready and safe for you to use.
