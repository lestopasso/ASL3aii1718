                There are words that can represent an era, and <bdi class="Bold">smart city</bdi> is one.<br> But what exactly is a smart city? We can define it as a city designed in a manner which can improve the <bdi class="Bold">quality of life and of the environment</bdi>, whilst <bdi class="Bold">decreasing consumption</bdi>. This becomes an important goal, especially when you consider that, within the year 2050, almost two thirds of the world’s population will live in towns and cities.<br> 
				In a smart city, a "technological heart" beats: <bdi class="Bold">innovation</bdi> is used to decrease the consumption of energy, to better manage waste, and to decrease traffic levels. And these are just a few examples. Thanks to innovation, it is possible to communicate important information for the life of the city in real time. 
				The integration of all systems into a single <bdi class="Bold">smart network</bdi> will make each one of us a key player.

                This will allow the city to expand and change on the basis of the citizens’ calculable needs. In a smart city, in fact, a citizen is not just a passive consumer of services and information: everyone can be a “sensor” and transmit data, report disservices, and release more energy into the grid.<br> And, naturally, citizens can contribute, by acting responsibly, to the sustainable development of their city.<br>
				The picture represents our idea of a smart city, but there are <bdi class="Bold">three anomalies</bdi>. What are they?<br>
				Read on to find out the answer, and discover the <bdi class="Bold">six innovations</bdi> that can help us to be eco-sustainable citizens.
