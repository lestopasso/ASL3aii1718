			<bdi class="Bold">Electricity</bdi>, once produced, travels through the grid. These grids can be viewed like “electricity roads” and traditionally have been one-way in order to produce an uninterrupted distribution of a large and constant flow of energy, generated by a few power stations, to a great number of consumers. 
			<br>Today, however, the world has changed. For example, power plants which use renewable sources (photovoltaic and wind sources) are continuously increasing and feature non-continuous production: the blade of a wind turbine functions only when there is wind, and photovoltaic panels need sunshine!

        <article class="col">
			Thus, <bdi class="Bold">smart grids</bdi> have been invented, which are both communication networks and active, bidirectional <bdi class="Bold"><a href="p13Ipertesto-RE.html" class="Colore">electrical grids</a></bdi>, which allow for the interaction between the producers and consumers, processing and monitoring an enormous quantity of information in real time. <br><br>
			<bdi class="Bold">The six characters</bdi> in the picture are all telling us something about smart grids. But <bdi class="Bold">one of them is lying</bdi>: who isn’t telling the truth?
